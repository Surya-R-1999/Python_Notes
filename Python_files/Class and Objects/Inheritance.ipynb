    "The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python determines the order in which the base classes are searched for resolving a method. It is defined by the C3 linearization algorithm, which follows the Depth First Left-to-Right (DFLR) approach to resolve conflicts in method resolution. The MRO of a class is represented by the mro() method, which returns a tuple of classes in the order they will be searched. In case of multiple inheritance, it ensures that the derived class always has the most derived version of the method and prevents the ambiguity in the inheritance hierarchy."
